            </span>
          </h1>
          
          <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-8">

            Learn what to avoid and how to fix these critical errors before your next application.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Generic, Non-Tailored Content</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            The biggest mistake according to 78% of hiring managers is submitting a generic resume 
            that shows no connection to the specific role.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> Recruiters immediately sense you're mass-applying without genuine interest.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Customize your resume for each position, mirroring language from the job description.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            <em>"I can tell within 10 seconds if someone has tailored their resume or just sent a generic version. 
            The generic ones almost always get rejected."</em> ‚Äî Technical Recruiter at Fortune 100 company
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Focusing on Duties Instead of Results</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            65% of hiring managers cited the absence of measurable achievements as a major weakness.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> Your resume blends in with everyone else who had your job title.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Use the CAR method (Challenge-Action-Result) and include metrics.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            <strong>Weak:</strong> "Responsible for customer service and handling complaints."<br />
            <strong>Strong:</strong> "Resolved 95% of customer complaints within 24 hours, improving satisfaction scores by 32%."
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Typos and Grammatical Errors</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            It may seem obvious, but 59% of hiring managers report they'll reject a resume with even a single typo.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> Errors signal carelessness and lack of attention to detail.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Proofread, use tools like Grammarly, and have someone else review it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            <em>"One otherwise excellent candidate wrote 'attention to detale' in their skills section. The irony wasn't lost on me, but their application was."</em> ‚Äî HR Director
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Poor Formatting and Visual Structure</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            54% of recruiters say they reject resumes that are visually overwhelming or difficult to scan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> With 6-7 seconds per resume, cluttered documents get skipped.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Use consistent formatting, plenty of white space, and clear section headers.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Aim for 3-5 bullet points per role, each 1-2 lines long. Use bold text strategically to highlight key achievements.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Length and Relevance Issues</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            52% of hiring managers cite inappropriate resume length among top issues.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> Too long suggests inability to prioritize; too short suggests lack of experience.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Use 1 page for early career (0-10 years), 2 pages maximum for senior roles.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Remove anything older than 15 years unless exceptionally relevant to the role.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Unexplained Employment Gaps</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            47% of hiring managers report that unexplained gaps raise red flags.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> Employers wonder if you're hiding something negative.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Address gaps briefly and positively.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Use years instead of months if gaps are small. For larger gaps, include relevant activities: freelance work, education, volunteering, or family responsibilities.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Outdated or Irrelevant Skills</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            44% of employers reject resumes showcasing obsolete or irrelevant skills.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> You appear out of touch with current industry standards.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Research current in-demand skills and highlight transferable abilities.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            <em>"Listing Windows 98 expertise or basic word processing as skills in a tech application screams that you haven't updated your resume or skills in years."</em> ‚Äî Engineering Manager
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Unprofessional Email Address</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            38% of hiring managers mentioned inappropriate email addresses as an immediate red flag.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> You undermine your professionalism before they read a single line.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Use a simple format with your name, like firstname.lastname@gmail.com.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            <strong>Real examples</strong> cited by recruiters: "partyguy85@" and "crazycatlady@" ‚Äî both from candidates with otherwise strong qualifications.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">9. Missing Keywords for ATS Systems</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            36% of hiring managers note that missing keywords and relevant terms often derails applications.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> Your resume never reaches human eyes.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Incorporate key terms from the job description, especially for hard skills and tools.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Use industry-standard terminology. If the job requires "data analysis," don't just say "worked with numbers."
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">10. Inappropriate Personal Information</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            29% of recruiters cite inclusion of irrelevant personal details as problematic.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700 ml-6">
            <strong>What happens:</strong> It appears unprofessional and raises potential bias concerns.<br />
            <strong>Instead:</strong> Skip personal details like age, marital status, religion, or political affiliation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-700">
            Also avoid mentioning hobbies unless they genuinely relate to the job or demonstrate relevant soft skills.
          </p>
