\# Matchrate.ai – Implementation Plan

\#\# 🚀 Overview

A structured roadmap for moving from MVP to a monetized, role-expansive platform. Built for speed, scalability, and clarity in each phase.

\---

\#\# 🧱 Phase 1 – MVP (Complete)

\- No auth, fast upload \+ GPT feedback  
\- Resume & JD input (text/upload)  
\- Structured AI report generation  
\- PDF export \+ basic logging  
\- Deployed via Vercel

\---

\#\# 🚧 Phase 2 – Monetization, Auth, STAR Tools (In Progress)

\#\#\# 🛠 Development Tasks

\- Add email/password and OAuth login via Supabase  
\- Create “My Reviews” dashboard (auth-only)  
\- Introduce usage gating (e.g., 1/day free tier)  
\- Role Selector (dropdown adjusts GPT logic)  
\- STAR-format detection \+ rewrite engine (first version)  
\- Stripe integration:  
  \- Subscription ($19/month)  
  \- One-time teardown ($49)  
\- Teardown request workflow for expert reviewers  
\- Admin dashboard: trends, keyword metrics, audit logs

\#\#\# 📅 Suggested Timeline

| Day| Milestone |  
|------|-----------|  
| 1–2  | Auth \+ History UI |  
| 3–4  | Stripe \+ Role Selector |  
| 5–6  | STAR Rewrite Module |

\#\# 🌟 Phase 3 – Smart Rewrite \+ Cover Letters (Future)

\- AI-powered resume rewriting (full resume regeneration)  
\- Cover letter builder from JD/resume input  
\- Chat interface: “Why is this weak?” follow-up logic  
\- Interview prep: tailored practice questions \+ feedback

\---

\#\# 👥 Team Setup Suggestions

\- Solo dev \+ part-time contractor model works well  
\- Recommended adds:  
  \- 1 part-time AI prompt/content specialist  
  \- 1 part-time UX/UI designer  
  \- 2–3 expert resume reviewers (contract)

\---

\- Feedback ratings (“Was this helpful?”)  
\- Slack/Discord for premium community  
\- CMS/blog via Notion or headless CMS
